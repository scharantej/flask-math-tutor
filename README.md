 ## Design for a Flask Application to Build a Maths Tutoring Site

### HTML Files

The following HTML files are needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This is the main page of the application. It should include a header, a navigation bar, and a main content area.
* `login.html`: This page allows users to log in to the application.

* `lessons.html`: This page lists all of the available lessons.
* `lesson.html`: This page displays a single lesson.
* `quiz.html`: This page displays a quiz for a particular lesson.
* `results.html`: This page displays the results of a quiz.

### Routes

The following routes are needed for the application:

* `/`: This route displays the main page of the application.

* `/dashboard`: This route displays the dashboard for logged-in users.
* `/profile`: This route displays the profile page for logged-in users.
* `/lessons`: This route lists all of the available lessons.
* `/lesson/<int:lesson_id>`: This route displays a single lesson.
* `/quiz/<int:lesson_id>`: This route displays a quiz for a particular lesson.
* `/results/<int:quiz_id>`: This route displays the results of a quiz.

### Additional Features

The following additional features could be added to the application:

* A messaging system to allow users to communicate with each other.
* A forum to allow users to discuss math problems and concepts.
* A progress tracking system to allow users to track their progress through the lessons.
* A reporting system to allow users to report problems with the application.
